# Random Airdrops Smokes Flares
Addon for [Random Airdrops](https://github.com/LeandroTheDev/random_airdrops) to add smoke flares in the game to manually call any airdrop.

### How it works?
- When calling any airdrop a horde will come to hunt you
- The horde is randomly increased or decreased by 50%
- The airdrop will land after all horde have been spawned (not killing)
